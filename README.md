# F150 Remote Start



## Problem

The range of the remote start on a 2014 F150 is abysmal. I often have to walk outside my house just to get the remote start to work. (Even with a fresh battery in the keyfob)

## Solution

Using a spare keyfob and a wemos D1 Mini microcontroller, create a semi-permenant remote start beacon that can be stationed near my truck, that can start my truck from my phone/home-assistant. 

The box is placed anywhere that is within range of wifi and the vehicle.

**Warning** : Never start a vehicle inside an enclosed space (such as a garage), the CO2 buildup is deadly. Only remotely start a vehile that is outdoors.

## Schematic

My particular keyfob has buttons that pull signal low (gnd) when pressed.

|GPIO| Pin|
| --- | --- |
| D5 | Lock |
| D6 | Unlock |
| D7 | Start |
| 2 | Status LED | 
| D3 | RGB Led | 


My particular truck has the following sequence to do a remote start
1. Press lock button 
2. Press remote start button twice
3. (Truck will start)
4. Press unlock button to enter truck

## 3d Printing

STL and 3MF files are included in the [3d prints](./3d%20prints/) folder. 

A pre-sliced multi color print for bambu x1c is provided. 

Printed with PETG

| Color | AMS slot | 
|--- | --- | 
| black | 1 |
| clear | 3 |
| blue | 4 |

## Leds

The lid is printed with transparent PETG fillament to show the internal Led status. 

```
Lock = Red
Unlock = Green
Start = Rainbow Animation
Stop = Blue
```

The LEDs will light up for 10 minutes (the max amount of time an F150 remote start will idle for), then return to white. 

## HomeAssistant

If you have the 'esphome' addon installed in HomeAssistant, the device will show up automatically. 
Once the device is added, it will show up on your dashboard.

## Development

Assuming you are using `direnv`, setup an `.envrc` file with environment variables to load. 

```
ls /dev/cu*   #note the address of the usb device
echo 'export USB_ADDRESS=/dev/cu.usbserial-xxxx' > .envrc
```

Make a `secrets.yaml` file

```bash
touch conf.d/secrets.yaml
```

Then add the following variables:
```yaml
wifi_ssid: "foobar"
wifi_password: "correct-horse-battery-staple"
web_username: "admin"
web_password: "correct-horse-battery-staple"
```

Then compile and upload the firmware

If you are running debug mode, it will join your wifi automatically. 
If you have debug mode disabled, it will create a new Wifi HotSpot. You can join the hotspot and join it to your wifi using your phone. 

`make run-ota`

Then navigate to [http://f150.local](http://f150.local) on the network

# F150 Remote Start

## Problem

The range of the remote start on a 2014 F150 is abysmal. I often have to walk outside my house just to get the remote start to work.

## Solution

Using a spare keyfob and a wemos D1 Mini microcontroller, create a semi-permenant remote start beacon that can be stationed near my truck, that can start my truck from my phone/home-assistant. 

The box is placed anywhere that is within range of wifi and the vehicle.

**Warning** : Never start a vehicle inside an enclosed space (such as a garage), the CO2 buildup is deadly. Only remotely start a vehile that is outdoors.

## Schematic

My particular keyfob has buttons that pull signal low (gnd) when pressed.

|GPIO| Pin|
| --- | --- |
| D5 | Lock |
| D6 | Unlock |
| D7 | Start |
| 2 | Status LED | 
| D3 | RGB Led | 


My particular truck has the following sequence to do a remote start
1. Press lock button 
2. Press remote start button twice
3. (Truck will start)
4. Press unlock button to enter truck

## Development

Assuming you are using `direnv`, setup an `.envrc` file with environment variables to load. 

```
ls /dev/cu*   #note the address of the usb device
echo 'export USB_ADDRESS=/dev/cu.usbserial-xxxx' > .envrc
```

Make a `secrets.yaml` file

```bash
touch conf.d/secrets.yaml
```

Then add the following variables:
```yaml
wifi_ssid: "foobar"
wifi_password: "correct-horse-battery-staple"
web_username: "admin"
web_password: "correct-horse-battery-staple"
```

Then compile and upload the firmware

`make run-ota`

Then navigate to [http://f150.local](http://f150.local) on the network
